```



#### Question 2: Calculate sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number
Write a Python program to accept a number from a user and calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number
For example, if the user entered 10, the output should be 55 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)

Expected output:
```
Enter number 10
Sum is:  55
```

The number must be divisible by five
If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the following number
If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop

Given:
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```

Expected output:
```
