8
9
10
```



## Question 2: Calculate sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number
Write a Python program to accept a number from a user and calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number
For example, if the user entered 10, the output should be 55 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)

Expected output:
```
Enter number 10
Sum is:  55
```
Hint:
Using for loop and range() function

```
2
4
6
8
10
12
14
16
18
20
```


## Question 4:Display numbers from a list using a loop
Write a Python program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

The number must be divisible by five
If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the following number
If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop

Given:
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```

Expected output:
```
75
150
145
```
Hint:
using break, continue and condation



## Question 5:  Print list in reverse order using a for loop


Given:
```
list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

Expected output:
```
50
40
30
20
10
```

Hint:
Using a reversed() function and for loop

## Question 6:  Display numbers from -10 to -1 using for loop

Expected output:
```
-10
-9
-8
-7
-6
-5
-4
-3
-2
-1
```

Hint:
Using a range() and for loop
## Question 7: Calculate the cube of all numbers from 1 to a given number
Write a Python program to print the cube of all numbers from 1 to a given number

Given:
```
-number = 6
```

Expected output:
```
Current Number is : 1  and the cube is 1
Current Number is : 2  and the cube is 8
Current Number is : 3  and the cube is 27
Current Number is : 4  and the cube is 64
Current Number is : 5  and the cube is 125
Current Number is : 6  and the cube is 216
```

Hint:
Using a range() and for loop

## Question 8: Create a function with variable length of arguments
Write a program to create function func1() to accept a variable length of arguments and print their value.

Given:
```
# call function with 3 arguments
func1(20, 40, 60)

# call function with 2 arguments
func1(80, 100)
```

Expected output:
```
# Printing values
20
40
60


# Printing values
80
100
```

Hint:
Using a function() and for loop
## Question 9: Return multiple values from a function

Given:
```
# call function calculation addition  and subtraction 
calculation(40, 10)

```

Expected output:
```
50, 30
```
## Question 10: Create a function with a default argument
Write a program to create a function show_employee() using the following conditions.

It should accept the employeeâ€™s name and salary and display both.
If the salary is missing in the function call then assign default value 9000 to salary

Given:
```
showEmployee("Ben", 12000)
showEmployee("Jessa")

```

Expected output:
```
Name: Ben salary: 12000
Name: Jessa salary: 9000
```
Hint:
Default arguments take the default value during the function call if we do not pass them. We can assign a default value to an argument in function definition using the = assignment operator.
## Question 11: Turn every item of a list into its square
Given a list of numbers. write a program to turn every item of a list into its square.


Given:
```
num = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49]

```

Expected output:
```
[1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401]
```
Hint:
for loop and append to list

## Question 12: Concatenate two lists in the following order


Given:
```
list1 = ["Hello ", "take "]
list2 = ["Dear", "Sir"]

```

Expected output:
```
['Hello Dear', 'Hello Sir', 'take Dear', 'take Sir']
```
Hint:
nested for loop and append to list
